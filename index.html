              <p> What am I about? Well, I'm glad you asked. I like to help people. I like to get involved. I like to create. Most of all, I like to have a good time while doing it.</p>
              <p> Throughout my young adulthood I've held a fairly wide range of occupations including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Musician</li>
          <li>Twitch Streamer</li>
          <li>Short Order Cook</li>
          <li>Fine Dining Server</li>
          <li>Landscape Technician</li>
          <li>Film Crew Art Director</li>
          <li>Medical Supplies Technician</li>
          <li>Transportation Hygiene Facilitator</li>
        </ul>
          <h2 class="header-text"><b>However!</b></h2>
              <p>Not long ago, with the inevitable quarter life crisis of turning 25 quickly approaching, I told myself</p>
              <p>Elric, it's time to make a change. You must choose your career path.</p>
          <h2 class= "dramatic-header-text">Use the Force within you!</h2>
              <p>Okay, maybe not that last part. But after careful consideration, deliberation, and caffeination, I did finally settle on a path. </p>
      
              <p>I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Immersion course at Thinkful and loving it. Learning coding bestows upon me the healthy challenge I had been missing in those other vocational fields. I look forward to becoming a strong web developer, working constructively with other like-minded individuals, and taking pride in the work I produce.</p>
